# SimpleCompounder
This is a compount interest calculator that utilizes the <cmath> standard library module of C++. The program calculates the accumulated compounded interest added to the principal value at the end of each month. Temporarily, the program only features monthly compounding assuming no dividends reinvested. This program will be updated with the following features:
  
1. Identical monthly dividends reinvested throughout the life of the compound.
2. Features that enables the user to calculate daily, weekly, quarterly, yearly, continuous, and date-customizable compounding.
